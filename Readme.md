## Fractionalized Ownership of Study Guides.
One of the key features of this platform is the fractionalized ownership of study guides. Instead of paying for the full content upfront, users can buy fractions of study guides (e.g., 10%, 20%) at a price proportional to their share. This allows multiple users to own different portions of the same content. The fractional ownership is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and fair distribution of ownership.

## Project Description.
Learn-to-Earn is a decentralized streaming platform where users can access study guides and other educational content by purchasing fractional ownership in the content. The platform is based on blockchain technology, allowing for transparent transactions and enabling users to earn rewards based on their engagement and ownership. Through this platform, learners can invest in educational materials, earn rewards, and learn in a decentralized environment.
